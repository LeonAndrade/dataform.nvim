# dataform.nvim

Dataform is a data transformation tool that was acquired by Google and has been integrated
into BigQuery.

dataform/core contains the core functionalities and a CLI interface for running all the
commands.

but the GCP Console offers some quality of life resources by regularly compiling queries
and running dry-run to validate SQL.

The idea of this project is to offer similiar functionalities for local development
with neovim.
